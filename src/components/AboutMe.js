            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h3>Hello, my name is Ajdin Bečirović and I am 23. I'm currently finishing my BoEE degree. I'm a passionate linux
                user and I've worked with many different techonologies throughout my time at collage. I'm a team player and I'm,
                as Rocky Balboa once said, willing to take the hits when it comes down to learning. I worked really hard in these
                3 years at collage, but am aware that I still have a mountain to climb when it comes down to working on real
                projects. For now I want to work on some of my own projects and finish my degree, but I'm hoping that the future
                will bring some job opportunities.</h3>
